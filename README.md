Makers Academy challenge week1

This project is for designing FAAST(Fast And Accessible Super Tube) which can be deployed into the London underground network.

The FAAST system will cater for the following:

* there will be a number of trains inside the system
* trains will travel from station to station
* inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the carriages of the train
* a passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station
* each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers
* each train is made of a number of coaches
* the passengers can only touch in a station if their account has more than Â£2
